## About Me
I am 24 years old and I work as a veterinarian. Unfortunately, in my country, the veterinary service has a weak digitalization. My goal: to introduce IT technologies into the veterinary service in order to improve the quality of customer service and make the work of veterinarians easier! That's why I want to become a front-end developer.
* My strengths:
  - ability to focus on a task
  - responsible
  - ability to prioritize
  - get along with people
  - I continue to study...

## Code Examples
```
// takes both a string and a character as input, and returns 
// a new string that has the passed character removed in all its positions.
const filterString  = (str, sym) => {
let i = 0;
let result = '';

while (i < str.length) {
  if (str[i] !== sym) {
    result = `${result}${str[i]}`;
    i += 1;
  }
 
  if (str[i] === sym) {
    i += 1;
  }
}
  return result;
};
